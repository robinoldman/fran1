                This article discusses the recent security crackdown in Punjab,
                India, initiated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government.
                Francis suggests that the intense response, including a
                statewide manhunt for a Sikh separatist, might be a politically
                motivated move to manufacture a security situation for electoral
                gains in the upcoming 2024 elections. The crackdown is viewed as
                a diversionary tactic by Modi, deflecting attention from
                unresolved crises in Punjab and India while creating a
                perception of a renewed threat of Sikh separatism.

                Here, Wade discusses the aftermath of Myanmar's 2021 military
                coup, outlining the brutal suppression by the junta, the
                formation of the National Unity Government (NUG), and the rise
                of armed resistance by People's Defence Force (PDF) battalions
                and ethnic groups. The conflict has led to extensive violence,
                displacement, and a growing death toll. It delves into Myanmar's
                military history, economic interests, and diverse resistance
                movements. Despite international sanctions, the military's
                aggressive stance indicates dim prospects for a peaceful
                resolution.

                Wade explores the impact of borders in a changing climate,
                questioning their permanence and role in environmental policies,
                referencing the National Rally party's eco-nationalism. James
                Crawford's book, "The Edge of the Plain," argues against the
                idea of borders as enduring and highlights instances, such as
                the Graffener Glacier, where borders shift due to climate
                change, challenging traditional notions. The piece also touches
                on the fluid nature of borders, geopolitical motivations, and
                the potential consequences of hard borders amid the climate
                crisis.

                Wade examines the often-overlooked phenomenon of "everyday
                resistance" during times of conflict, drawing on examples from
                Nazi Germany and Rwanda, where small acts of nonconformity
                challenged the pervasive violence. Roger Mac Ginty's book,
                "Everyday Peace," delves into the subfield of peace and conflict
                studies, exploring how localized, bottom-up acts of solidarity,
                tolerance, and noncompliance, collectively termed "everyday
                peace," can disrupt the divisive logic of conflict and
                contribute to healing in fractured societies.

                The book "Neither Settler nor Native: The Making and Unmaking of
                Permanent Minorities" by Mahmood Mamdani argues that
                postcolonial violence in former European colonies is a
                continuation of colonial logic, asserting that genocides, ethnic
                cleansing, and population transfers serve similar ends to the
                violence deployed by European powers during colonization,
                challenging the notion that such violence represents a return to
                tribal ways and emphasizing the role of the nation-state model
                in perpetuating violence; the author explores historical cases
                from Native American extermination to the Nuremberg trials and
                examines the impact of these events on contemporary societies.

              <p class="card-text">
                Protests against the military coup in Myanmar continue,
                revealing the fragility of the country's political landscape;
                however, Western engagement is criticized for its shortcomings,
                and promises of action by Western governments are seen as flawed
                and lacking a nuanced understanding of Myanmar's internal power
                dynamics, with historical instances of assertive rhetoric and
                ineffective sanctions undermining their influence; the article
                argues for a more dynamic, tailored, and grassroots-focused
                approach, emphasizing the need to avoid performative
                misrepresentations of Western influence and to support Myanmar's
                people in their fight for democracy through transparent and
                encouraging solidarity.

                States (SIDS), particularly those in the South Pacific and the
                Caribbean, to the impacts of climate change, leading to rising
                sea levels and the potential displacement of their populations.
                Wade emphasizes the historical context of statelessness and the
                legal and political challenges faced by the stateless,
                particularly in the aftermath of the First World War. He
                highlights the impending threat of disappearing nations due to

                In the aftermath of Myanmar's military coup and the detention of
                Aung San Suu Kyi, a resilient counter-movement has emerged,
                marked by widespread protests and a diverse coalition with
                varied political, cultural, and socioeconomic interests. While
                the military attempts to suppress the demonstrations through
                internet shutdowns and violence, the opposition remains
                determined, drawing on Myanmar's history of resistance against
                state power. Dspite the potential for increased violence, the
                military's brazen seizure of power has united the population and
                triggered a display of cross-party unity.

                Judith Butler, a prominent academic in gender studies and
                critical theory, has garnered extensive discussion and critique
                for her influential works, such as "Gender Trouble." Her recent
                book, "The Force of Nonviolence," explores the need for a
                nonviolent ethic rooted in global interdependency to counter
                various forms of violence, including neglect and discrimination
                perpetuated by institutions. Butler emphasizes the importance of
                challenging exclusionary boundaries of selfhood and promoting a
                relational version of identity for a more inclusive and less

              <p class="card-text">
                Ngũgĩ wa Thiong’o reflects on the enduring impact of colonial
                education, particularly in Kenya's Alliance High School, where
                English was imposed as a symbol of power, rationality, and
                intelligence while local languages were denigrated. In his
                seminal work, "Decolonising the Mind," Ngũgĩ explores how
                colonial classrooms served as tools of psychological conquest,
                emphasizing the lasting consequences of language manipulation in
                colonized societies beyond Africa.

                Myth and Identity in a divided Britain : an Interview with james
                Meek
              </h5>
              <p class="card-text">
                Journalist and novelist James Meek delves into Brexit's impact
                on Britain's socio-political fabric in "Dreams of Leaving and
                Remaining." He underscores the significance of understanding
                cultural myths and economic grievances, highlighting the
                intertwining of power perceptions in various communities. Meek's
                reflections extend to personal complexities, historical temporal
                shifts, and reconciling conflicting sentiments among those who
                voted to remain. His novel, "To Calais, In Ordinary Time," set
                during the 14th-century Black Death, explores contemporary
                issues of class, social breakdown, and impending catastrophe.

              <p class="card-text">
                James C. Scott, a Yale professor, blends political science,
                anthropology, and agrarianism. Notable for "Weapons of the
                Weak," he challenges state formation narratives in "Against the
                Grain." Scott underscores the significance of recognizing
                everyday resistance, even in developed countries, and critiques
                state benevolence and the historical roots of authoritarianism
                in Southeast Asia, addressing the Rohingya crisis in Myanmar.

                In 2012, a young man near Sittwe, Myanmar, described the
                aftermath of Buddhist mobs attacking a Muslim neighborhood,
                expressing sympathy for his neighbors' actions and revealing a
                severed friendship with a Rohingya boy due to perceived ethnic
                differences. Despite acknowledging the individual's character,
                the man believed the Rohingya's ethnicity made the entire group

                Reports in late May revealed the discovery of nearly 140 graves
                in abandoned human trafficking camps near the Thailand-Malaysia
                border. These camps were sites of brutal violence and held
                trafficked refugees and migrants for extended periods. Despite
                previous revelations of such camps, the mass graves underscore
                the persistence and growth of human trafficking operations in
                the region, raising questions about the effectiveness of efforts
                to combat this illicit trade.
